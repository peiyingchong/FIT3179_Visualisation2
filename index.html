    <p class="class-select"> <br> In today's data visualization, we delve into a critical issue that touches the lives of many - suicide. <br>
        While the goal of this visualization is to raise awareness, promote understanding, and encourage support for those affected by suicide,<br>
         we understand that the content discussed can be emotionally challenging and triggering for some viewers. <br> <br> 
         This data visualization includes statistics, stories, and information related to suicide. <br>
         It may contain content that is distressing or unsettling. <br>
         We want to ensure that you are aware of this in advance so you can make an informed decision about proceeding. <br>
         If you feel that this topic may be distressing or triggering for you, we encourage you to prioritize your emotional well-being.<br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to foster compassion, increase awareness, and open up dialogues that contribute to suicide prevention and mental health support. <br>
        We hope that through this visualization, we can collectively work toward a more empathetic and supportive world.
